  # Rules:
  #
  #   * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
  #     by under-population.
  #   * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next 
  #     generation.
  #   * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by 
  #     overcrowding.
  #   * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
  #     as if by reproduction.
